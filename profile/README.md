The WildStang Robotics Program supports [FRC](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/what-is-first-robotics-competition) teams [111 "WildStang"](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/111) and [112 "Plus One"](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/112). The program is comprised of students from Township High School District 214 in Chicago's northwest suburbs and is supported by [our many generous sponsors](https://www.wildstang.org/ws_wp/2021-current-sponsors/).

Here you will find all of our robot source code dating back to [1998](https://github.com/wildstang/1998_software), various electrical projects, scouting apps, and other supporting projects. The competition robots are not developed in the public, but projects are generally published before the following season. If you're interested in developing software for your robot, check out [our framework](https://github.com/wildstang/robot_framework).
